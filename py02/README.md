Hot is Generative AI is very high.

Big revolution is internet but Now probably Generative AI is a big revolution.

Web development is most hard working and low cost.

Generative AI is very hipe => only lang chain (300,000), and we have no resources.

mypy => install intellisence of mypy in vs code, then restart vs code.

# String

String is very powerfull (string or regulation expression)

All programming language string data type is very important.

Anything will be stored in a variable which is data type is called a string.

sequence of a characters or collection of a characters is called a string.

### String Definitions

#### Single Quotes

You can define a string with single quotes.

```
my_string: str = 'Hello, World!'
```
#### Double Quotes

Alternatively, you can define a string with double quotes.

```
my_string: str = "Hello, World!"
```

#### Triple Single Quotes

Triple single quotes allow for string definitions that span multiple lines.

```
my_string: str = '''Hello,
World!'''
```

#### Triple Double Quotes

Like triple single quotes, triple double quotes also allow for multi-line string definitions.

```
my_string: str = """Hello,
World!"""
```

### String Formatting

#### Basic Techniques

##### Using %s and %d

You can use %s for string and %d for integers.

```
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 30
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
```

##### Using .format()

The .format() method is another way to format your strings.

```
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 30
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
```

##### Using f-string (Python 3.6+)

f-strings provide a concise and readable way to include the value of Python expressions inside strings.

```
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

#### Advanced Techniques

##### f-string Expressions

You can include Python expressions within f-strings.

```
x: int = 10
y: int = 20
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x+y}.")
```

##### f-string with Format Specification

You can format numbers using f-strings.

```
pi: float = 3.14159
print(f"Value of pi to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")
```

### Naming Conventions

#### Variables

Use snake_case for variable names.

```
my_variable: int = 10
```

#### Constants

Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.

```
PI: float = 3.14159
```
