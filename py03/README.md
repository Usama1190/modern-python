#### Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

#### Logical Operators: and, or, not, :=

... and many more.

For a comprehensive list, refer to the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/reference/operators.html'>official Python documentation</a>.

### Comments

In Python, comments are lines that are not executed by the interpreter. They're used to explain code and improve readability.

Single-line comment: Starts with #

```
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment
```

Multi-line comment: Python doesn't have explicit multi-line comment syntax, but you can use triple-quoted strings.

```
'''
This is a multi-line
comment or docstring
'''
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Zen of Python

The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 aphorisms that capture the philosophy of the Python language. To view them, simply run the following command in your Python environment:

```
import this
```

While some may seem cryptic, they all provide valuable insights into writing clean, readable, and efficient Python code.
